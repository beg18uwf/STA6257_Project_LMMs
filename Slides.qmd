## Introduction

-   Linear Mixed-Effects Models can be used to model correlated data
    -   Take the form of cross sectional or longitudinal data
-   Called "mixed" because they simultaneously model fixed and random effects
    -   fixed effects model average trends
    -   random effects model the extent to which these trends vary across levels of some grouping factor
-   Main application for mixed-effect models is in psychology due to the nature of their data and repeated observations across trial participants
